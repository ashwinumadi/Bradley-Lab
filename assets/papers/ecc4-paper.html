<b>Abstract</b>
<p>
We describe a method for introducing variations into predefined dance
sequences using a chaotic mapping.  A symbol sequence representing a
dance piece is mapped onto a chaotic trajectory, establishing a
symbolic dynamics that links the dance sequence and the attractor
structure.  A choreographic variation on the original piece is created
by generating a trajectory with slightly different initial conditions,
inverting the mapping, and using special corpus-based interpolation
schemes to smooth any abrupt transitions.  Sensitive dependence
guarantees that the variation is different from the original; the
attractor structure and the symbolic dynamics guarantee that the two
resemble one another in both esthetic and mathematical senses.
