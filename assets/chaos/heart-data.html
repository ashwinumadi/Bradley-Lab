<href="http://physionet.org/challenge/chaos/">Here</a> is a data set
of heartbeat time series in health and disease derived from continuous
ambulatory (Holter monitor) electrocardiograms (ECGs) of:
 
<ul>
<li> 5 ostensibly healthy adult subjects (all in sinus rhythm),
 
<li>5 subjects with congestive heart failure (CHF) syndrome all in sinus
rhythm, and
 
<li> 5 subjects with atrial fibrillation (AF), a cardiac (atrial) arrhythmia
producing an erratic and typically rapid ventricular response.
</ul>
 
Each of these time series is about 24 hours in length and contains about
100,000 RR intervals.  In addition to time series of all RR intervals between
observed heart beats, PhysioNet has also provided a set of "filtered" series
from which outliers (associated with abnormal beats, artifacts, and intervals of
signal loss) have been removed.
 
<p>
For each of the 10 healthy and CHF time series, the time of day
corresponding to the beginning of the time series, and the gender and
age of the subject are provided. This information is not available for
any of the 5 AF time series, nor are there annotations for any of the
time series with respect to activity level and sleep. Sleeping hours
in healthy subjects, however, reliably correspond to sustained periods
during which the inter-beat intervals are consistently relatively long
for that individual.
