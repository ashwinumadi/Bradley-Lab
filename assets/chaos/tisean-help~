Windows:

Just download the binaries and run them from the Windows command
prompt.

Some folks have gotten TISEAN to work by copying the executable files
in the Bin folder of the Windows TISEAN Package and using the command
prompt through MatLab's system( ) function.  

For example if 'mutual.exe' and 'datafile' are in the current
folder, we can run:

  system('mutual datafile -o output')

which creates the 'output' file in the current Matlab directory..

-----
Mac:

Download the binaries, then install them and fire up a Terminal
window.  (You can also install them by typing 'brew install tisean' if
you're a brew user.)  Navigate to the Tisean folder to run the
commands.  You may need to use the ./ syntax - i.e.,

./mutual datafile -o outputfile

rather than just mutual datafile -o outputfile.

-----
In the CSEL:

TISEAN is in /usr/lib/tisean on all of the CSEL desktops, as well as
these two ssh-accessible machines:

 elra-01.cs.colorado.edu
 elra-02.cs.colorado.edu

You can sign up for an account on these machines by going to
sac.colorado.edu and choosing "CSEL" from the dropdown.  If you have
any trouble, email trouble@cs.colorado.edu.

The IT folks were kind enough to add a shell function called 'tisean'
that will put /usr/lib/tisean in your $PATH.  Just open up a shell,
type 'tisean', then all of the tools should be available to you.

To run {\tt mutual}, for instance, you would just type the command
name and then the arguments that specify how you want to run it (e.g.,
what input data, what parameter values, how you want it to output the
data):

mutual datafile -o outputfile

If that doesn't work, try using the ./ syntax described above:

./mutual datafile -o outputfile
