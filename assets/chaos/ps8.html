Here is a <a href="ps8data.zip"> zip file of the three data sets for
problem set 8 </a>.

unavoidable trouble because of the size of these data sets and your
(computer's) memory, please come see me.

To decompress this archive, just double click it.  ('unzip ps8data.zip'
will do the same thing on a unix box)
