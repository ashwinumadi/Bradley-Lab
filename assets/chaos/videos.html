<h3>Online Materials for CSCI 4446/5446:</h3>

We will be using some online materials from a MOOC offered through the
Santa Fe Insitute's 
<a href="https://www.complexityexplorer.org/"> Complexity Explorer
platform</a> to supplement the lectures, readings, and assignments in
this course.  If you have not done so already, you will need to go to
that webpage and register for the MOOC.  It doesn't cost anything or
engender any formal responsibilities to do to, BTW.

<p>

The main mechanism for this will be a couple of short videos to set
you up for each of the 30 lectures this semester, together with an
online quiz about each one.  These quizzes will not be graded-there
are solution videos online as well-but they will prepare you to absorb
the in-class material more easily and to pass the ten online ``unit
tests'' that <i>are</i> part of your grade.
<p>
The timing here is up to you; one good strategy is to watch the videos
before the corresponding lecture and to use the online quizzes
afterwards, to check your understanding.  (If you score 100% on the
quiz, there's no need to watch the quiz solution videos, but they're
there for you if you need or want them.)

<p>
There are a couple of problems here and there on the unit tests that
aren't applicable because our homework is different than the MOOC
assignments: e.g., the question about the trapezoidal solver on unit
test 6.  Just skip those; I'll normalize that out of the grades.

<p>

The lecture-video mapping is listed below, as well as on the
problem-set handouts.  The timing for the unit tests is completely up
to you.  You may take them whenever you wish (any time before the
final exam).  Some students like to do this along the way; others have
found that they're useful in studying for the final.
