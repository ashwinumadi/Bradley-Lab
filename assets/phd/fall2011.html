requirements and guidelines for the essays that comprise the

is not trivial; don't be surprised if this takes half an hour or more.)
Not all of you are eligible to apply, but writing these kinds of
essays is an extremely useful exercise, which we'll go through over
the next month or so.
<li> Review the last two weeks' worth of reading assignments and read chapter II of
<i>The Elements of Style</i>

<b>email me a pdf version</b> before class next week.  <i>Please don't
include any identifying information in your essay!</i> We are going to
trade these around and do anonymous reviews.  Here are some <a
href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/how_to_apply/application_materials">helpful
hints</a> on how to write these essays.

<!-- following reading should have been assigned last week -->

<li> Read the "Important Choices..." Chapter of <i>A Ph.D. Is Not

Importance of Stupidity in Scientific Research".</a>

<!-- establishing research pgm chapter of Feibelman should have

The ESRL-CIRES is particularly interesting because it's 
tightly coupled with the University of Colorado... it may even 
only be for CU students, though I'm not sure of that. It also 
might be only for PROSPECTIVE students, but that's a little 
hazy and I'm currently testing their resolve on that 
requirement at the moment. ;)
