Dear Liz,

thanks for your acceptance to be a reviewer in the area of qualitative 
reasoning for IJCAI 99.

Here are the information about specific times that you must commit to in 
order to ensure that we meet all of the deadlines. The point of making this
commitment in advance is so that everyone can work to ensure that the
necessary dates are kept free of other commitments. As in the case of
PC member deadlines, these dates are not negotiable and the entire
process is highly constrained by forces beyond our control.

Here are the times that reviewers have to be aware of:

Jan 15-17 - each reviewer receives by email a list of authors
	and institutions and sends to an email server at Brown
	by return email a list of those that pose a conflict of 
	interest. These email exchanges must be completed by 
	Sunday, January 17, 9:00am PST.

Jan 22-26 - reviewers receive their papers. It's extremely important
	that reviewers look at their papers immediately and note any
	discrepancies between what they were told via email to expect
	and what they actually received.  Also now is the time to fix
	the errors regarding conflict of interest that inevitably
	creep in despite all the effort to avoid such conflicts.

Feb 9 - reviews are due to program committee members. Yes, this 
	doesn't leave a lot of time for reviewing - doing it right 
	means that you make sure you can commit the necessary time.

Feb 10-17 - PC members work with reviewers to make final decisions;
	this may require exchanging email with the PC member and the
	other reviewers. Papers printed in the IJCAI proceedings are
	often touted as being roughly equivalent to papers in journals;
	whether or not this is true, we will do our best to ensure that
	IJCAI'99 papers are reviewed as carefully as those submitted
	to journals - as usual, allowing some flexibility for papers
	that present really neat new ideas perhaps not quite in a form
	suitable for an archival journal. 

Feb 18 -  final reviews are due at the AAAI office.


We need contact information for every reviewer, including an
email address and a physical address for express mail that we
can depend on. We also want your interest profile for its use in the 
process of the assignments of papers.

Here is the "form" for the contact and profile information
(requirements regarding addresses in this case are imposed by the size
of labels used for automatic addressing):

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Please note that your name and mailing address must fit on 5 lines with a
maximum of 45 characters per line.  The address must be one that carriers
like Federal Express can deliver to (no PO Boxes) and a phone number is
also required by the carriers.  Please abbreviate appropriately so your
name and address fit within these bounds.   This does not apply to e-mail
and phone numbers.

The "work or day phone" is required for express mail service.  The
"home or weekend phone" is required in case we need to contact you
during the weekend(s) on the schedule.  The keywords help in selecting
papers and should come from those on the IJCAI'99 call for papers on the 
<a href="http://www.dsv.su.se/ijcai-99/">IJCAI'99 home page</a>.

The profile should be no more than fifty words. See

A nice paper: well-posed problems, sensible solutions, nice
applications, well written.  (Very good use of examples and figures,
in particular.)  However, I wonder about the novelty: most of
MAJORCLUST is right out of an algorithms textbook.  I also wonder why
this is advertised as an AI paper (and particularly as a ML paper!)
The real "AI" seems to be in choosing the metric to use to assign
weights to the edges of the graph, but section 5 seems to indicate
that that step is completely domain dependent and is done by a human
expert.

Define "optimum" in "optimum number of clusters" (p4, left bottom).
Give a high-level qualitative description of the rationale behind
\Lambda early on: in the abstract and intro, at least -- e.g.,
"weighted according to the size and connectedness of the subgraph."
Also, say more about why this is exactly the right way to choose this
weighting -- what it gives you that other choices would not.  (The
only "justification" that I found was the parenthetical comment on p4
about how the results resemble human esthetics.)

Explanations are lacking in many places.  "...may not apply to all
kinds of systems...a broad class of..."  Which kinds of systems?  Why?
Explain items 1 and 2 in the second paragraph of 2.1 using references
to fig 1, and explain the strong splitting condition better.  Also
point back to fig 1 in the definitions of domain concepts,
connectivity, and contraction.

Why do sections 4.2 and 4.3 exist?  If MAJORCLUST was really tested on
circuit layout or graph visualization, show the results.  If it
wasn't, make it clear (e.g., "there are two interesting problems on
which we plan to test this...")

Section 5.3 appears to have been written in some haste; it needs work.
Various small typos here and there.

I enjoyed reading this paper, but most of MAJORCLUST looks like it's
straight out of an algorithms textbook, and there's very little AI in
here.  I checked "leaning to accept" because I believe the authors can
address these concerns by with a careful reworking.

This paper presents the weighted partial connectivity criterion for graph
clustering and a heuristic (local, suboptimal) algorithm for identifying
clusters based on it.  As the authors correctly argue and illustrate,
clustering is an important task in a variety of domains.

While the criterion is indeed interesting and extends to weighted graphs,
the clustering algorithm is relatively simplistic and does not sufficiently
capture the proposed concept.  The authors should investigate other
approximation heuristics and approximation criteria.  Also, no empirical
results are presented in a domain of relevance to AI to better determine
the adequacy of the proposed criterion.

I suggest to the authors to continue the line of research and submit again
the paper when more algorithmic and empirical results have been obtained.

Then the referees argue by email for a while, cc'ing the program committee
member who is in charge of the paper:

From: Liz Bradley <lizb@peradam.cs.colorado.edu>
Subject: Re: Z503: IJCAI Review: weak disagreement

There's more agreement in these three reviews than it may initially
appear, and the common concern ("Where's the AI?") is a very important
one.  This paper should probably be rejected.

[I think I'm missing a message here; clearly the program committee
member weighed in with a "strong accept"]

From: Johan de Kleer <dekleer@parc.xerox.com>
Subject: Re: Z250: IJCAI review: disagreement

I am struck that you would be leaning to accept if not for length
issues.  So before I just argue more for reject, I'd like Gerhard to
argue why its a strong accept.

This is the program committee member who is in charge of the paper:

From: Gerhard Friedrich <gerhard.friedrich@ifi.uni-klu.ac.at>
Subject: Re: Z250: IJCAI review: disagreement

The authors give improvements regarding a method published at IJCAI
97. In my opinion these improvements are significant and relevant (see
Section 2 and Page 2, right column at the bottom and the comments of
Liz). However, the presentation could be enhanced.

If you are going to reject the paper then please revise your comments
and tell them why their contributions are not significant and/or not
relevant. I'm constantly approached by colleagues which complain about
IJCAI review comments that cannot be understood.

Regarding this paper the authors might get the impression that their
paper is rejected because

* they don't present a compelling example
* it is hard to read for AI researchers
* their paper is a little bit too long

Which means the rejection is based on arguments w.r.t. the
presentation and not the technical content.

I think it will contribute a lot to the reputation of IJCAI if you can
give them understandable reasons for rejecting their paper (or maybe
you could accept it).

Regards,
Gerhard

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The final decision was a "weak reject:"

From: Jakob Mauss <mauss@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>
Subject: IJCAI-99: final decisions

Hello Liz,

Peter Struss asked me to inform you about the final decisions
regarding the papers that you have reviewed.
We have sent the following decisions to IJCAI: 

...
##Z503#bradleyl=AL#dekleerj=R#joskowiczl=RL#strussp=R+1## 
...

reviews:
A  Accept
AL Leaning to accept
RL Leaning to reject
R  Recect

final decision: strussp=
A+2 accept definite
A+1 accept weak
A+0 accept marginal
R+0 reject marginal
R+1 reject weak
R+2 reject definite

The above decisions are actually recomendations by Peter Struss.  We
have currently no information whether they have been finally approved
by IJCAI-99.

[Note that Peter Struss <> Gerhard Friedrich; Struss, being senior and
busy, clearly offloaded the work onto a subordinate.]
