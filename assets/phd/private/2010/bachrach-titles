"How to give a nonlinear talk and still make some semblance of sense"


"Random samplings of my expensive project, sprinkled with "exciting"
performance metrics that demonstrate my work to be a giant waste of
time in the real world."

I could not think of a comment for last week's talk since it was so
poorly presented.

"There may be some benefits in making hardware in the way we make software"

"Hardware/Software together as one"

"hardware/software system to increase abstraction
of design without greatly sacrificing the efficiency of runtime".

The importance of understanding regional in spatial data

"Connecting Software and Hardware closely make parallel programming
more easily."

Designing asynchronous communication for logic circuits

Asynchronous Logic Automata - Escape Bit Hell on a Leap of Faith?

"Asynchronous Logic Automata: Lots and lots of animated circuit-logic diagrams"
