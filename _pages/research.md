<h3>Current Projects </h3> 
This is nerw.
<ul>

<li> <a href="{{ '/current_projects/nltsa/' | relative_url }}">Nonlinear time-series 
analysis</a>: theory, algorithms, and applications!</li>

<li> <a href="{{ '/current_projects/topology/' | relative_url }}">Computational 
topology</a>: techniques for describing the morphology of an object, using only 
discrete data
about that object, and applications of those algorithms to data analysis.</li>

<!-- To do: update topology.html to have all the papers and to
mention Zach's work and the new grant -->

<li> <a href="{{ '/current_projects/bees/' | relative_url }}">Collective behavior 
in honeybees</a>: understanding and modeling resource distribution in honeybee colonies.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Past Projects</h3> 

<ul>
<li> <a href="{{ '/past_projects/paleoWPE/' | relative_url }}">Information-theoretic 
analysis of ice-core data:</a> the Shannon entropy rate of time-series data from ice 
cores reveals some pretty cool stuff about the paleoclimate.</li>

<li> <a href="{{ '/past_projects/sunspots/' | relative_url }}">Solar-flare prediction
</a>: using computational topology and computational geometry to engineer features 
for forecasting methods.</li>

<li> <a href="{{ '/past_projects/earthquake-ML/' | relative_url }}">Seismic event 
detection</a>: using time-series analysis to engineer features for phase-picking methods.</li>

<li> Human movement dynamics: this area has two distinct foci:</li>

<ul> 

<li> <i> understanding</i> the nonlinear dynamics of movement (e.g.,
<a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/news/10.1063/PT.5.7029">
runners with amputations</a>)</li>

<li> <i> manipulating </i> those dynamics: in particular, 
<A href="{{ '/past_projects/chaotic-dance/' | relative_url }}">using machine learning 
and the dynamics of chaos to generate human motion sequences</A>.</li>

</ul> 

Riffing on that, students in my group (and
in <a href="{{ '/courses/chaotic_dynamics/' | relative_url }}"> my class</a>) have used 
chaos to
generate variations on different kinds of sequences,
including <a href="{{ '/past_projects/chaotic-dance/' | relative_url }}">dance</a>, <a 
href="http://www.kunc.org/post/climbing-chaos">
rock climbing</a>, and many other movement genres - as well as music
genres ranging from jazz guitar to tabla.

<li> <a href="{{ '/past_projects/flame/' | relative_url }}">Flow control</a>: intentionally 
inducing, suppressing, and "guiding" chaotic flows in a fluid using micromachined flaps in 
the boundary layer of a jet.</li>

<li> <a href="{{ '/past_projects/computer-dynamics/' | relative_url }}">The nonlinear dynamics 
of computer performance:</a> frameworks for modeling computers as deterministic nonlinear 
dynamical systems, and using those models to forecast their performance.</li>

<li> <a href="{{ '/past_projects/dos/' | relative_url }}">Control of internet attacks</a> using 
nonlinear dynamics, stochastic models, and control theory.</li>

<li> <a href="{{ '/past_projects/rps/' | relative_url }}">Recurrence plots</a>: a visualization 
tool that brings out correlations in time-series data.</li>

<li> <a href="{{ '/past_projects/pll/' | relative_url }}">Phase-locked loop</a>: using chaos to 
improve the capture range of a common and useful electronic circuit.</li>

<li> <a href="{{ '/past_projects/cscience/' | relative_url }}">CScience</a>: an integrated software 
system that helps geoscientists construct <i> age models</i> (which relate depth to calendar age) 
for an ice or ocean-sediment core.</li>

<li> <a href="http://ace.hwr.arizona.edu">ACE</a>: an argumentation system that helps geologists 
deduce the age of a landform, given
samples of rocks from that landform.  As a successful, deployed workflow-based system for doing 
earth science, ACE has been featured
on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/earthcubeworkflow/workflow-vignettes">
EarthCube Workflow Community Group's "workflow vignettes"</a> website
and in the <a href="http://www.isi.edu/%7Egil/EarthCube/EC-WorkflowsRoadmap-September2012.pdf">
<i>EarthCube Workflows Roadmap for the Geosciences</i> </a> document (see pp33-36).</li>

<li> <a href="{{ '/past_projects/reachability/' | relative_url }}">Intelligent computation of 
reachability sets</a>: automatically exploring the evolving geometry
of the set of allowed paths of a spacecraft.</li>

<li> <A href="{{ '/past_projects/model/' | relative_url }}">PRET</A>, a computer program that 
deduces the internal dynamics of a nonlinear black-box system solely
from observations of its outputs, automating the process known to control theorists as <i> 
system identification</i>.</li>

<li> <A href="{{ '/past_projects/features/' | relative_url }}">Feature recognition in scientific 
data sets</A>: computer tools for recognizing when a numerical simulation
is going bad, when an atmospheric data set contains a hurricane, when two photos of the sky show 
the emergence of a supernova, etc.</li>

<P>Many of the links in the "Current Projects" section above point to documents that describe 
current research opportunities.  These range from one-semester undergraduate research projects 
through M.S. and Ph.D. theses to postdoctoral appointments.  Please shoot me an email message 
if you're interested in any of these opportunities.  And I'm happy to work with smart, independent 
students on projects of their own choosing, even if I don't know much about the associated area.
Here are some examples:
