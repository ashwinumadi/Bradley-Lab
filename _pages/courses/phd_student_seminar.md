    The ESRL-CIRES is particularly interesting because it's 
    tightly coupled with the University of Colorado... it may even 
    only be for CU students, though I'm not sure of that. It also 
    might be only for PROSPECTIVE students, but that's a little 
    hazy and I'm currently testing their resolve on that 
    requirement at the moment. ;)
