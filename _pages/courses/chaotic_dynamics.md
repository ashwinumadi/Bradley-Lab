-->

<li>
<a href="{{ '/assets/chaos/syllabus.pdf' | relative_url }}">
General information and administrivia</a>
</li>

<li>
A version of CSCI 4446/5446 is available through
the <a href="https://www.complexityexplorer.org/"> Complexity Explorer
MOOC platform</a> housed by the
<a href="http://www.santafe.edu/">
        Santa Fe Institute</a>.  We'll be supplementing the on-campus
course with some of these materials this spring.  These MOOC materials
may be useful to you in other ways as well, especially if you have to
miss a lecture.  Please go to that website, register for the course
(which is called "Nonlinear Dynamics: Mathematical and Computational
Approaches"), and look around a bit, including through the
"supplementary materials" page.
</li>

<li> <a href="{{ '/assets/chaos/ps1.pdf' | relative_url }}">
Problem Set 1</a>: logistic map.  You can use the logistic map app on
the Complexity Explorer MOOC to check that your solutions are correct
(look in the "supplementary materials" tab).  Also, you may wish to
take some time this week to review section 1 of the ODE notes listed
below ("Liz's written notes and videos") if your knowledge of
differential equations is at all rusty.
</li>

<li> <a href="{{ '/assets/chaos/ps2.pdf' | relative_url }}"> Problem Set 2</a>: bifurcation diagrams
and Feigenbaum's constant.  Again, you can use the Complexity Explorer
logistic map app mentioned above to check your solutions.  
</li>

<li> <a href="{{ '/assets/chaos/ps3.pdf' | relative_url }}"> Problem Set 3</a>: fractals.  For some
examples of fractals in the wild,
click <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/class/class.htm">
here</a> or <a href="http://paulbourke.net/fractals/googleearth/">
here</a>.

        TISEAN</a> time-series analysis toolkit is available in our cloud IDE
        at https://coding.cs.colorado.edu via JupyterHub.  This is the
        recommended method for accessing these binaries, as they are already
        pre-compiled and ready for use.  Login with your CU Credentials and
        select the "4446/5446 Chaotic Dynamics" tile to get started. (If you
        do not have a stable internet connection, the offline option is to use
        the <a href="https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/64136/pages/setting-up-the-cu-cs-virtual-machine">
        CU CS Foundations Virtual Machine</a> which also has the pre-compiled

        CS department virtual machine ("VM").  Instructions for downloading
        and installing your virtual machine
        are <a href="https://foundation.cs.colorado.edu/vm/">here</a>.  After
        that, run 'sudo apt-get install tisean' to install the TISEAN tools.
        If you have path problems (can't run it from where you want to), here
        is a set of commands that 'user' would use to run the 'mutual' command
        on the file 'data2.first250sec' in the 'Downloads' directory and put
        the 'answer' in that directory.  Modify as appropriate:
        <br>
        user@cu-cs-vm:~$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/tisean
        <br>
        user@cu-cs-vm:~$ mutual ~/Downloads/ps8data/data2.first250sec -o ~/Downloads/ps8data/answer
        -->
        </li>
        <li>
        If you want to install TISEAN on your own machine,
        these <a href="{{ '/assets/chaos/tisean-help.html' | relative_url }}">

Einstein did.  Read a bit about
