<h3> J. Garnett, <i>Adaptive Nonlinear Resource Distribution Control
</i>, Ph.D. thesis, 2004.</h3>

<b>Abstract</b>


Control systems for software resources, such as network routers, are difficult 
to design because of the nonlinear nature of these systems and the bursty 
nature of the demands that are placed upon them. We present an adaptive, 
nonlinear, model-reference control strategy that mitigates the effects of 
saturation in these systems and demonstrate the ability of this controller 
to help network routers gracefully survive denial-of-service attacks.
