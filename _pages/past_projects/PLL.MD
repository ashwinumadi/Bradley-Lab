<h2>
Using Chaos to Broaden the Capture Range of the Phase-Locked Loop
</h2>


Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are a common and useful family of circuits;
their function is to hunt for and synchronize to an external sine wave
signal.  Every radio contains a PLL that helps it "lock on" to the
closest station.  The range over which the circuit can accomplish this
task, called the <i>capture range</i>, is an important design
parameter - consider, for instance, the button on your car radio that
shifts its range from "city" (a narrow band that lets the circuit
capture one radio station from all of the closely spaced stations in
an urban area) to "country" (a wide band that gives the circuit more
leeway in which to hunt).


Chaos can be used to broaden the capture range, improving the design
of the circuit.  Specifically, we judiciously drive the loop into a
specific chaotic regime, using the denseness of the system's chaotic
attractor to establish the control-theoretic property known as <i>
reachability</i> for the loop's locked state, thereby expanding the
capture range out to the original lock range limits.
