<h2>Seismic Event Detection from Volcanic Regions using Feature Extraction and Deep Learning</h2>


<h3>Project Description</h3>


The goal of this project is to detect and classify volcanic events in time-series 
data from seismographs.  To that end, we utilize a state-of-the-art machine-learning 
methodology that hybridizes the power of deep learning with the expertise of domain 
experts.  We train and test these models on a data set from the southern Taupo 
Volcanic Zone, New Zealand: specifically, the 2012 eruptions at the Te Maari 
craters of Mt. Tongariro on the North Island of New Zealand. These events happened 
to be along the popular hiking trail Tongariro Crossing. There were no injuries in 
the Te Maari eruptions, but in recent years other popular volcano tourist sites, 
e.g., Whakaari/White Island in New Zealand and Mount Ontake in Japan, have suffered 
similar steam-driven (phreatic) volcanic eruptions as Tongariro, but with tragic 
outcomes including multiple fatalities (Yamaoka et al., 2016; Park et al., 2020). 
Such steam-driven eruptions are particularly hard to anticipate at present owing 
to an absence of large-scale motion of magma that produces signals like surface 
deformation that portend a
future eruption. Investigating the small earthquakes associated with volcanoes 
could elucidate changes in the interaction of magma and fluids that lead to eruptive 
activity.  Our preliminary work suggests that machine-learning approaches can detect 
small earthquakes that were previously missed by human analysts. If this conjecture 
is borne out by our project, the results could scaffold new insights into the 
dynamics of earthquake swarms that are associated with eruptions -- insights that 
could lead to effective prediction methods for these dangerous events.
