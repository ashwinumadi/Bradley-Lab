<h3>Project Description</h3>


PRET automates the process that control theorists call <i> system
identification</i>: deducing the internal dynamics of a black-box
system solely from observations of its outputs.  PRET builds ordinary
differential equation (ODE) models of physical systems, linear or
nonlinear; it accomplishes this by wrapping a layer of AI techniques
around a core of traditional system identification (SID) methods.
This AI layer executes many of the high-level parts of the SID
procedure that are normally performed by a human expert: it
intelligently assesses the situation at each stage of the process and
then reasons from the available information to automatically choose,
invoke, and interpret the results of appropriate lower-level
techniques.  During its parameter estimation phase, for example, PRET
uses qualitative reasoning techniques to derive good starting values
for a nonlinear least-squares solver call, allowing the latter to
avoid local extrema in the regression landscape.  Like human experts,
PRET uses a heterogeneous collection of reasoning modes during the
model-building process, and the intelligent orchestration of these
modes is critical to its success.  This knowledge representation and
reasoning task is performed by a special first-order logic system,
which selects and coordinates the appropriate reasoning tactics in
order to guide the search quickly and accurately to an ODE model that
accounts for the important behavior of the system.


PRET is designed to be an engineer's tool; because of this, it differs
sharply from other AI modeling programs in a variety of important
ways.  First, it explicitly avoids all attempts to "discover" any
physics that falls outside its user's specifications; rather, it works
very hard to find a <i>minimal</i> model - one that matches the
observations to within a user-prescribed resolution, and no more.
Second, it does not adhere to a single, neat paradigm; rather, it
calls upon a wide variety of reasoning techniques, ranging from
classic AI ideas like constraint propagation to standard engineering
tricks like power series, and it works hard to use the right technique
at the right time.  This mix of methods is the source of PRET's
ability to solve real-world problems in a variety of engineering
domains.  Third, PRET works directly with the physical world, using
sensors and actuators to interact with its target systems --- an
<i>input/output modeling</i> approach that is both very powerful and
extremely difficult because of the nonlinear control theory that is
involved.



In terms of performance, PRET attained the functional level of a smart
undergraduate.  It solves garden-variety textbook SID problems fairly
well, struggles occasionally with the harder ones, and has
successfully (with some minor hand-holding concerning the
relationships between different coordinate systems) modeled one
real-world system: a <a href="{{ '/assets/images/rccar.ps' | relative_url }}">radio-controlled
car</a> destined for use in a soccer-playing robot project.  SID is an
essential first step in the design of a system like this; without an
accurate ODE model of the car's dynamics, it is impossible to build a
controller to direct its behavior according to a plan - and ODEs are
not part of a Radio Shack spec sheet.  From an engineering standpoint,
modeling this device is a nontrivial accomplishment; nonlinear SID is
considered to be an open problem.  The AI issues in this example were
also interesting: PRET not only duplicated the model that the project
analyst had derived by hand; interacting with the AI tool also helped
the human expert refine his explicit mental model of the system.
