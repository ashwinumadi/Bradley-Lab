<h3>Research Interests </h3>

My current focus is on <b>the analysis of time-series data from complex adaptive nonlinear systems</b>.  I use a variety of approaches, ranging from the traditional ones from nonlinear dynamics (delay reconstruction, Lyapunov exponents, etc.) to information theory and topological data analysis.

In the past, I have done some work in the area of artificial intelligence: in particular, computer tools that autonomously analyze and/or design things.  My focus has largely shifted away from this area.  <i><b>Note: I do not work on AI, including machine learning. Please do not contact me about projects in that area.</b></i>
