The pendulum data files are in /pub/cs/misc/lizdata on
ftp.cs.colorado.edu.  <p>

The device is a driven-vertex single pendulum; the block holding the
bearings on which the bob swings is attached to a ball slide (like a
typewriter carriage) which is driven sinusoidally up and down.  The
drive frequency can be controlled - from 0Hz to ~7Hz, and the natfreq
of the device is ~1-2 Hz.  The third Bryant/Miles paper in the 1990
<i> J Aust Math Soc </i> series describes this system, though in its
antiseptic mathematical form.  The entire thing is on a telescope
mount, so it can tilt back in increments from bob-vertical to
bob-horizontal.  I'm not even going to attempt ASCII graphics to
describe this - if you wish, I can send you a photo of the setup, as
well as printouts of the data in graphical form.  I do have a double
pendulum like the one in my .sig, but it is not instrumented yet
(that's hard - involves telemetry.)  <p>

The angle sensor is a 512-slit optical encoder, so angle can be
measured to within ~.7 degree.  The student who was working on the
hardware and I/O for me did three acquisition runs at each of the
drive frequencies and 'gravities' that he tried.  The runs cover
anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes; one is sampled uniformly at
512 microsecond intervals, another at 1.28 microseconds, and one was
sampled *whenever the pendulum moved* (the latter, being nonuniform in
time, is probably not of much interest to you time-series types unless
someone has extended Takens while I wasn't looking.)  We tried four
different 'gravities' and fourteen different drive frequencies, but
not all combinations thereof.  In the 20 data sets, two converge to
fixed points, ten to periodic orbits (many via 'chaotic' transients a
la Pomeau-Mainville (sp?) intermittency), eight are solidly chaotic,
and one is indetermininate.  Importantly, the initial conditions are
NOT constant and weren't measured; you'll have to use the first data
point as the initial condition.

Each data point is of the form #(time theta omega):
<p>

#(.09287931249999999 1.2271846644580364e-2 .13370408537099926)
<p>

Theta is mod 2 pi.  The omegas were computed from the thetas, not
measured, and so are inaccurate to the extent that the hardware delays
were inaccurate or not constant.  These I/O problems actually turned
out to be serious enough to make the omega data useless, but if you
are just going to embed the thetas, it shouldn't matter.  <p>

You'll see all sorts of interesting things in the data, notably the
fact that the bearing friction is <b> not </b> the nice linear/viscous
term that we all like to write down for the pendulum (there is
backlash and hysteresis and asymmetry.)  <p>

I am working on a paper based on these data, on the topic of the
disparities between the device and the standard model and the
implications of that for control, to be submitted to <i>Chaos</i>.
The abstract of that paper is given in the file that contained the
hyperlink to the file that you are currently reading.  I don't mind if
you use my data even if what you're doing closely resembles this, but
I'd appreciate being cited (both the paper below and as the source of
some of your data.)  I would also greatly appreciate reports of your
results, either formal or informal, ASAP, so I can learn more about my
pendulum - and cite you in my paper as well :-) <p> Have fun.  <p>
