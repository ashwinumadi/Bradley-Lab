RK 4 should be fine to integrate the HH eqs of motion. I assume you want
to output y-py, whenever x=0 and dx/dt > 0.  One way is to integrate the
eqs of motion, and at each step look for a sign change in x.  When x
crosses 0, interpolate the values of y and py such that x would be exactly
zero. Off hand, I forget the exact interpolation scheme, but I don't think
that it is difficult.  

Another way is to use the so-called "Henon method" to generate the
Poincare section.  Here you do the same checking for zero crossings of x
at each time step, but instead of interpolating you do the following neat
trick.  As soon as x crosses zero, switch to another (equivalent) set of
eqs where x is the independent variable. Take one integration step in the
negative x direction of magnitude delta_x, where delta_x is the value of x
as soon as x crosses zero. This will put all of the variables "exactly" on
the x=0, dx/dt>0 Poincare section.  You can read abou this in more detail
in Henon's paper: M. Henon, On the Numerical Computation of Poincare Maps,
Physica D 5, 412, (1982).
